# .inq files represent a thing to monitor and verify.
# Redacted MUST, at minimum, have a "check host" recipe.
# host.inq is the naming convention for checking the

  # Typically you want to use all your RAM but not go into swap.
  # We'll trigger an alert if the system goes beyond 20% swap
  # usage for more than a minute.
  #
  if swap > 20% for 4 cycles then alert

  #
  # You want to know if anything is using an excessive
  # amount of CPU time.  100% is one core so this will alert if any process
  # is pegging a core.  You'll need to increase this if you have a
  # multi-threaded process which is designed to use many cores, e.g.
  # many Java applications.
  #
  if cpu:user > 95% for 4 cycles then alert

  #
  # Running out of disk space will not make you look good to the boss.
  # Alert if the root partition is running out of space.
  #
  # You can add any mount point, e.g.
  #    if disk:/backups > 90% then alert
  #
  if disk:/ > 90% then alert
