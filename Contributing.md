# Contributing to Redacted

## Open an issue

Tell us about bugs so we can fix them, please!  Include your redacted
version, OS version you are running and any relevant configuration or
log output.

## Submit a Pull Request

Pull requests should:

 1. Come with a solid description of what you are trying to achieve.
 1. Have a reasonable amount of tests which verify the changes.
 1. Fit the existing code style and design of the project.
 1. Not require any third party code.

When in doubt, open an issue first and let's chat about what needs to be
done and how.

## Legal

By submitting a Pull Request, you disavow any rights or claims to any
changes submitted to this project and assign all rights to those changes
to Contributed Systems LLC.

If you cannot or do not want to reassign those rights (your employment
contract for your employer may not allow this), you should not submit a PR.
Open an issue and someone else can do the work.

This is a legal way of saying "If you submit a PR to us, that code becomes
ours".  99.9% of the time that's what you intend anyways; we hope it doesn't
scare you away from contributing!
